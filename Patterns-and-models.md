# To make an economic assistant, we need artificial intelligence and deep learning models:

## AI and Deep Learning Models for Financial Assistant Chatbot

In this document, we present several open-source and free AI and deep learning models that we have considered for use in our financial assistant chatbot.

**Large Language Models (LLMs):**

* **Hugging Face Transformers:** This vast collection of pre-trained LLM models includes GPT-2, DistilBERT, T5, and others, all suitable for various NLP tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.
